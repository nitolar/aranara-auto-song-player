Too lazy to play notes on lyre? No problem look how easy can it be.


## NOTICE

Macros are banned by Hoyoverse (aka. miHoYo), so technically your account can be banned!

I haven't seen anyone getting banned for [midi player](https://github.com/3096/genshin_scripts) (other script that plays on lyre automatically) but bear that in mind!
